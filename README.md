# DS Portfolio

This repository contains data science projects for the purpose of self-study and practice. These projects cover topics including data scraping, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and machine learning tasks. Machine learning projects are done using python libraries such as scikit-learn and tensorflow. Please refer to the [_mathematical derivation notes_](https://github.com/anyangpeng/DS_notes/tree/main/ML_notes) for details on the algorithms.

## Projects

### [Project chemicals](https://github.com/anyangpeng/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Project_chemicals)

This project demonstrates how to use tree-based models (**XGBoost**, **RandomForest**)to perform regression tasks. The dataset used in this project was scraped from _CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics_. The goal is to predict the boiling point of a given chemical knowing its structural information. Additional python packages used: _XGBoost_, _rdkit_, _shap_

### [Project color](https://github.com/anyangpeng/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Project_color)

This project demonstrates how to use **K-Means** algorithm to perform clustering tasks. The goal is to extract the palette of a given painting. Additional python packages used: _cv2_, _collections_
